# 🎌 Anime Explorer (Angular Project)

## 📌 Project Overview

Anime Explorer is a web application created for learning purposes, focusing on **Angular**, **API integration**, and **frontend architecture**.  
The project uses an **Anime API** that provides detailed information about anime titles released from **1980 to the present**.

The application allows users to browse:

- 🔥 Trending anime  
- ⭐ Popular anime  
- 🆕 Newly released anime  

Users can select an anime to view its details, with the long-term goal of enabling free streaming through available external platforms.

# AngularRouting3

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
